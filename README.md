# Artificial Intelligence Project - Samsung Innovation Campus 2024

This repository contains the final project for the Artificial Intelligence course of the **Samsung Innovation Campus 2024**. The project explores various machine learning techniques applied to traffic accident analysis, including classification, clustering, and regression tasks.

## Project Description

The main goal of this project is to apply Machine Learning models to understand, classify, and predict patterns related to traffic accidents. It consists of two main notebooks:

- `ProyectoSIC_Clasificacion_Agrupamiento.ipynb`: focuses on **classification** and **clustering** of accident data.
- `ProyectoSIC_Regresion.ipynb`: focuses on **regression** tasks, such as predicting the number of victims or accident severity.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project was collected from two main sources:

1. **INEGI (National Institute of Statistics and Geography, Mexico)**  
   Official traffic accident statistics in Mexico.  
   ðŸ“Š Website: [https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/accidentes/#datos_abiertos](https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/accidentes/#datos_abiertos)

2. **Kaggle (Community dataset)**  
   A dataset of traffic accidents shared by the data science community.  
   ðŸ“Š Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oktayrdeki/traffic-accidents](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oktayrdeki/traffic-accidents)

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
